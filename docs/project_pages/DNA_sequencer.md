# DNA Sequencer

I made one of my first personal programming projects in high school for an IB Biology assignment. In the course, we were learning about how to sequence DNA, to recognized codons, and the protein strands they make up. Fresh out of my first computer science course from my sophomore year, I decided to apply a computerized solution to this problem. I implemented a program in Python that could read between and transcribe DNA and RNA, producing outputs codon and protein sequences. It was a fun foray into using my early learning in coding for practical applications.
